# Digital Marketing Tactics Webpage

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to improve my own skills with HTML and CSS.  I built this project so that that I could learn to enhance and build upon 
existing web development code.  This project solves the problem of original code not meeting appropriate standards of accessibility or organization.  The 
assignment was to implement improvments to the code that allowed it to meet those standards.  I rebuilt and modified some of the code with improvments such as 
semantic tags, alternate text for images, and consolidated CSS.  I also made sure all of the page's links functioned correctly.

## Usage

This is a single webpage.  The only elements that are truly interactive are the links at the top right of the page.  These links skip to the different
blue bars on the page.  

Here is a link to the deployed webpage:

Below is a screenshot of the webpage.  Unfortunately, the only way I could get it to all fit on the screen at once was to take the screenshot when the browser was in mobile mode.
