# Digital Marketing Tactics Webpage

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to improve my own skills with HTML and CSS.  I built this project so that that I could learn to enhance and build upon 
existing web development code.  This project solves the problem of original code not meeting standards of accessibility or organization.  I refactored the code so that it 
met those standards.  In this project, I learned about how to organize code, and how to follow accessibility standards, such as alt text for images.
